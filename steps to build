Steps to Build Python Video to Audio Converter Project

Let us look at the steps to create the Video to Audio Converter Project:

Importing the modules
Creating the GUI Window
Browse Function
Save Function
1. Importing the Modules:

import moviepy.editor
from tkinter.filedialog import *
from tkinter import *
Here we are importing the required modules.
2. Creating the GUI Window:

window=Tk()
# Set the size of the tkinter window
window.geometry("700x350")
window.title("PythonGeeks")#give title to the window
Label(window, text="VIDEO TO AUDIO CONVERTER",bg='orange', font=('Calibri 15')).pack()# a label
Label(window, text="Choose a File ").pack()
Tk() – is a method that helps us create a blank GUI window.
geometry() – is a method that helps us fix the size of the GUI Window.
title() – is a method that helps us fix the title of the GUI Window.
Label() – is a method that helps us create a widget to display text on the GUI WIndow.
pathlab = Label(window)
pathlab.pack()
#creating buttons
Button(window,text='browse',command=browse).pack()
Button(window,text='SAVE',command=save).pack()
Button() – is a method that helps us create a button on the GUI Window.
3. Browse() function:

def browse():#browsing function
    global video#global variable
    video = askopenfilename()
    video = moviepy.editor.VideoFileClip(video)
    pathlab.config(text=video)#configure method
Creating a global variable
askopenfilename() – this function helps the user browse files from the GUI Window.
config() – this method configures the pathlab label.
4. Save() Function:

def save():
    audio = video.audio#convert to audio
    audio.write_audiofile("sample.wav")#save as audio
    Label(window, text="Video Converted into Audio and Saved Successfully",bg='blue', font=('Calibri 15')).pack()# a label
Video.audio – converts the video file to audio file.
write_audiofile() – this method save the audio file in the system.


Summary

Woahoo! We have successfully completed the Video to Audio Converter Project using Python. We got to learn about different modules and functions in them. Hope you enjoyed learning
